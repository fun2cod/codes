# codes
Write a program which computes the multiplication of two large numbers (integers) entered as command line arguments. 
Each number can have any number of digits (up to the maximum length of a CLI argument, try at least 20 digits for each).
It is mandatory to provide two implementations of the algorithm computing the multiplication (one of them can use
e.g.: BigInteger class another one should implement the algorithm from scratch).
Program must allow to choose one of the implementations by arguments.
It is also mandatory to implement at least one unittest which computes multiplication using both algorithms for
the same inputs and compares results which must be equal.
